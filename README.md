# VIVIT Spatiotemporal for Hierarchical Anomaly Detection in Video Scenes

This repository contains Colab notebooks for the VIVIT spatiotemporal model, which focuses on hierarchical anomaly detection in video scenes. The project includes various stages such as data processing, model implementation in the Keras TensorFlow framework, hyperparameter tuning, cross-testing, and transfer learning.

## Project Overview

The VIVIT spatiotemporal model aims to detect anomalies in video scenes by leveraging hierarchical representations. The project is divided into several stages, each of which is covered in a separate Colab notebook:

1. [Data Processing](./data-preprocessing): This folder covers the preprocessing and preparation of the video datasets for training and evaluation. It includes steps such as video loading, frame extraction, normalization, and data augmentation.

3. [Hyperparameter Tuning](./hyperparameter-tuning): This folder focuses on optimizing the model's hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. It explores different hyperparameter configurations and uses techniques like hyperband to find the optimal settings.
